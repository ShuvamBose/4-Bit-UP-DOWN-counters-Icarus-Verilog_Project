# Icarus-Verilog-Sem-3-Project_DDCO_LAB
This program is used to demonstrate the fashion in which 4 Bit UP & DOWN counters function.
<br />**ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT:**<br />
A simple 4-bit up-down counter project made using Icarus 
Verilog as a part of the Digital Design and Computer 
Organization Laboratory at PES University.
We have designed an Iverilog program constructing a 4 Bit 
Up/Down counter which portrays the importance of counters in 
the calculation process of ALU. 
Counters are used in many different applications. Some count 
up from zero and provide a change in state of output upon 
reaching a predetermined value (Up counter); others count 
down from a pre-set value to zero to provide an output state 
change (Down counter).
However, some counters can operate in both up and down 
count mode, depending on the state of an up/down count mode 
input pin. They can be reversed at any point within their count 
sequence.
